## Abstract

We present a new video quality database, BVI-VFI, which contains 540 distorted sequences generated by applying five commonly used VFI algorithms to 36 source videos with various spatial resolutions and frame rates. We collected more than 10,800 quality ratings for these videos through a large scale subjective study involving 189 human subjects. Based on the collected subjective scores, we further analysed the influence of VFI algorithms and frame rates to the perceptual quality of interpolated videos. Moreover, we benchmarked the performance of 28 classic and state-of-the-art objective image/video quality metrics on the new database, and demonstrated the urgent requirement for more accurate bespoke quality assessment methods for VFI.


## Downloading the database

Please fill in this [registration form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG1fDz7azbERMp_0LZtGJZ19UQlFMREhWU0E3QzRVMkYyT0VFTUg3T041Qy4u) to get access to the download link. After the form is submitted, you should be able to access the dataset within 2 working days.

**Note:** if you have filled in the form before and been given access to the previous version of the BVI-VFI database, you will also be able to access the new larger database. There is no need to register again.


## Description

### Videos
The BVI-VFI database contains 108 reference and 540 distorted sequences, as well as the differential subjective scores for all the distorted videos.
The .mp4 files contained are compressed with H.264 (libx264) under lossless mode (crf=0). The naming of the files are as follows:
```
<seq name>_<spatial resolution>_<frame rate>_<VFI method>.mp4
```

Files ending with "_GT.mp4" are the reference sequences.

### Subjective data
The subjective data (differential scores) are provided in .json format.
- `all_diff_raw.json`: the differential scores calculated for all the judgements of all users. Each score = (score assigned by the participant to current reference) - (score assigned by the participant to current distorted sequence).
- `all_z_scores.json`: the differential scores normalised over the scores given by each user (see paper for more details).
- `DMOS_XXXXp.json`: the DMOS scores computed for each distorted sequence.
